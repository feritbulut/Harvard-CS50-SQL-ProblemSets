## Technologies Used

- **SQLite** - For most problem sets
- **SQL** - Querying, schema design, views, indexes
- **Python** - For Python-integrated database problems

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the problem set folder you want to explore
3. Use SQLite or the appropriate database system to run the SQL files

```bash
# Example: Running a query from the cyberchase problem set
sqlite3 cyberchase/cyberchase.db < cyberchase/1.sql
```
